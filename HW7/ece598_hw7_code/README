Questions

4a. Virtual memory on Linux allows for more than (or less than) the address space would normally permit. 
4b. Filesystems are used to organize data in a consistent way for usage acrosss different machines (i.e. if 
your flash drive doesnt have a file system, your computer can't read it). Yes, you could write a system 
in machien code and just make the machine execute it. It doesn't necessarily need to be organized.
