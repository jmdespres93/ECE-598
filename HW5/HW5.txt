Homework 5


1. Cache paramaters
A Haswell machine has a 44-bit physical address space, 32-kB L1 data cache, 8-way set associative,
64-bytes per line.
	(a) How many bits are used to calculate the offset?
		6 bits
	(b) How many bits are used to calculate the line?
	    6 bits
	(c) How many bits are used for the tag?
		32 bits

2. Cache problem
	(a) ldrb r0, 0x0000080f
		hit
	(b) ldrb r0, 0xffffffff
		miss, don't have to write back to memory
	(c) strb r0, 0x00000810
		miss, do have to write back to memory

3. Bzip2 cache behavior on the x86 Haswell Machine

(a) Measure and report the L1 instruction cache miss rate.
Use instructions:u and L1-icache-load-misses:u for the events.
    19,161,577,786      instructions:u                                              
            74,256      L1-icache-load-misses  

            .00039% instruction cache miss rate

(b) Measure and report the L1 data cache load miss rate.
Use L1-dcache-loads:u and L1-dcache-load-misses:u

     6,244,601,884      L1-dcache-loads                                             
       311,872,148      L1-dcache-load-misses     #    4.99% of all L1-dcache hits  

(c) Measure and report the L3 cache miss rate
Use cache-references:u and cache-misses:u
       139,708,202      cache-references:u                                          
         1,162,110      cache-misses:u            #    0.832 % of all cache refs    

       3.297069345 seconds time elapsed

4. equake_l cache behavior on the x86 Haswell Machine
Recall that running equake looks something like this:
perf stat -e instructions:u,L1-icache-load-misses:u \
/opt/ece571/equake_l.specomp/equake_l < \
/opt/ece571/equake_l.specomp/inp.in
(a) Measure and report the L1 instruction cache miss rate.
Use instructions:u and L1-icache-load-misses:u for the events.

 1,443,186,902,155      instructions:u                                              
        13,444,229      L1-icache-load-misses                                       

     139.460698935 seconds time elapsed


(b) Measure and report the L1 data cache load miss rate.
Use L1-dcache-loads:u and L1-dcache-load-misses:u

   527,105,849,376      L1-dcache-loads                                             
    30,756,898,016      L1-dcache-load-misses     #    5.84% of all L1-dcache hits  


(c) Measure and report the L1 data cache store miss rate.
Use L1-dcache-stores:u and L1-dcache-store-misses:u

   140,445,522,240      L1-dcache-stores                                            
   <not supported>      L1-dcache-store-misses   

     134.715203180 seconds time elapsed

(d) Measure and report the L3 cache miss rate
Use cache-references:u and cache-misses:u

    13,644,184,798      cache-references:u                                          
     8,067,618,834      cache-misses:u            #   59.129 % of all cache refs    

     134.471519065 seconds time elapsed


5. Bzip2 cache behavior on the Jetson
Now run the bzip2 benchmark on the ARM64 jetson machine. (recall from the last homework, just
ssh from haswell, ssh jetson).
You will note on the jetson machine that perf list shows a lot of events missing. For some reason
the linux-kernel is missing support for them, but if you look at the ARM Cortex-A57 manual:
http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/classes/ece571/DDI0488C_cortex_a57_
mpcore_r1p0_trm.pdf
in Chapter 11.8 you will see support is listed for them.
The perf built-in events for Cortex-A57 were not really updated until Linux 4.4 but we are running
3.10 on our system.
(a) For icache rate try measuring r14:u (which is L1_ICACHE) and r01:u (which is L1I_CACHE_REFILL).


    10,490,856,637      r14:u                                                       
           169,493      r01:u                                                       

      10.449327328 seconds time elapsed


(b) Measure and report the L1 data cache load miss rate.
Use r40:u (which is L1D_CACHE_LD) and r42:u (which is L1D_CACHE_REFILL_LD).
(c) Measure and report the L1 data cache store miss rate.
Use r41:u (which is L1D_CACHE_ST) and r43:u (which is L1D_CACHE_REFILL_ST).

        21,306,760      r53:u
