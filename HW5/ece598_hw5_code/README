5a. The system would be locked up waiting for a key to be pressed. It wouldn't be able to do anything else (except higher priority interrupts). 

5b. It's for safety/security. You don't want to be able to have access to all of the nitty gritty of your OS all the time. That's a dangerous business.

5c. Interrupts and system calls can bring your back into the kernel after already entering the user mode.

5d. ABI is an application binary interface. It is the agreed upon way to interface with a system. It makes it so that functions can know what to expect and so that different people's code can work together.
